# Performance Comparison of Linear Regression, LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net Models on the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset

<p align="justify"> Bike sharing is a system in which bicycles provided by operators can be rented by users for a specified period at an affordable cost. Over time, this system has rapidly evolved and become a primary transportation option in many cities worldwide, such as in Seoul, South Korea. This development has led to an increased demand for bike rentals, necessitating an accurate prediction model to forecast the number of bike rentals. Therefore, this study aims to develop and compare the performance of ordinary linear regression models with regularized linear regression models, such as Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net, using a dataset comprising historical data on bike rentals in Seoul during the years 2017-2018, publicly available on the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand">UCI Machine Learning Repository website</a>. The research findings indicate that the LASSO regression model outperforms other models, with R-Square values of 0.700 for the training data and 0.703 for the testing data.</p>
